We're not starting from scratch - we've already got customers in more than a hundred countries - including names like Adobe, Chevron, Lockheed Martin & Zillow. Check out www.exavault.com. This is DevOps in the true sense of the word. We believe in 'configuration as code' -- almost all of our physical systems are provisioned via chef, and we use docker to build and deploy our application and associated services. As with any DevOps job, there's going to be some ops -- doing things like tuning and tweaking the database servers -- but much of it will be the dev part: building out our configuration management system, improving our docker images, improving our deployment process, writing tests for all of that, and more. We're looking for a leader -- someone who is technically gifted, but also has the business side & soft skills to ultimately be the DevOps manager, interfacing with the rest of the team, including senior leadership, on planning our infrastructure roadmap. In a bit more detail:  You'll work with our senior technical staff to run all of the day-to-day operations of our systems. Unlike most companies, we use our own custom-built bare-metal hardware -- built using many of the concepts pioneered by Backblaze in the B2 storage pod. You'll think about the big picture -- what do we need next year, in three years, and in five years. What technologies are coming that we need to pay attention to? You'll deal with the hands-on -- maintaining and grow our chef configuration management system, our docker containerization system, and VMWare virtual machine environment. And you'll constantly keep one eye on the future, figuring out if we need to replace any of those with something else. You'll maintain and improve our Icinga monitoring system, which keeps a watchful eye on the performance of our systems. You'll handle the network layer too, managing our redundant juniper switching fabric and our pfsense firewalls. Yes, there will be pager duty with this job. We rotate pager duty -- you get one week on and one week off.  That's a lot, we know. This is the sort of job where the challenge will be different every day, and you'll rarely find yourself doing the same thing twice. Requirements Now, in terms of what we're looking for from you:  You should definitely have done this stuff before. 'DevOps is new(ish), and we don't much care if you've come from the dev side or the ops side, but today you should be fluent in both. You should be just as comfortable stringing a bunch of awk, grep, and cut commands together as you are discussing the finer points of class inheritance. There's no magic number of years that you should have under your belt, but this isn't a junior position, so if you haven't been doing this type of work full-time for at least 5-7 years, this might not be the right role for you. You should have a good business head on your shoulders. This position isn't all technical -- you'll need to understand the business case for what we're doing and make decisions and recommendations based on the larger business goals of the company. You should be very experienced with things like CentOS, chef, Docker, GlusterFS, Python, PHP, Node, HAProxy, pfSense, MySQL. We don't expect you to literally have in-depth experience with all of those, but you should be hitting at least several. Of course, there's all the standard stuff. You need to be a nice person. You need to communicate well. You need to be able to work remotely, with a team around the world. You need to be enough of a morning person that you can get on a call as early as 9 am PT ( noon ET ). We know DevOps folks often like to work late, and that's OK, but you should be roughly available during the business day.  ExaVault Offers...

This is a combo position -- we want somebody that can put together a mad UI but also has the ability to actually build what they design. Old school, you know? We've got clients from Adobe to Zillow, and everyone in between — check out www.exavault.com. We look to companies like Apple, Square, and Twitter, with great technology, great design, and simple, well-thought out feature sets. (And yes, we all use Macs.) We care about doing things right, creating a quality product, and building the best user experience possible. If you care about the same things, we want to talk. You'll be working on our web app, our website, and a number of internal applications. Our app stack is a modern one -- we run react.js on the frontend and node.js on the backend. Your day-to-day will be working with our existing design and engineering team, which is about eight people. You'll collaborate with one other front-end developer, as well as with some very talented backend and DevOps engineers. Requirements  First and foremost, you should have an excellent eye for design. You should know great web UI when you see it, and be able to explain why it's great (even if you didn't create it!). You should have strong listening and ideation skills and be able to produce elegant mockups with multiple design directions to present to teams after discovering their needs. You should be able to at least touch on the product management side of things -- discussing needs with users and designing solutions to fit their needs. You should have a strong knowledge of HTML5/CSS, and ideally some of the modern frameworks like ReactMUI or TailwindsUI. You should be able to build out whatever you design. JavaScript/React experience is not required, but certainly welcome. Of course, we're looking for self-starters - candidates who can jump in quickly without a lot of direction, and learn by asking the right questions. Previous experience working in a startup is a plus too, although not required. Finally, you should have a solid portfolio of web application design. We want to see that you've built great web interfaces before, not just great websites.  ExaVault Offers... For our full-time employees, we offer:  A competitive salary.

This is a part-time position for 3-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule.  Our schools are open in-person so this job is to be in-person. Our open hours will be generally 3-8pm on select weekdays. We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a ""teaching methodology"" than a curriculum.  Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.

Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.  One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids.  Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger kids and Javascript/HTML, Python and beyond for older kids.  Specialty programming like Unity or Swift helpful as well! 2. Code Class.  Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.  This position rocks because you will: * Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application. * Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area. * Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology  Requirements What do we want from you?  Read on. * PASSION.  All caps!  This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge. * Great Communicator.  There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids! * Street Cred.  Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school.  Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience. * Coding Skills.  Strong grasp of basic procedural programming.  General knowledge of languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront. * Experience teaching kids in Scratch/Snap or other languages is a plus  Interested?  Send us an email with a cover letter and resume and let's do it! "

This is a serious offer, and only highly qualified and serious candidates will be considered.  REQUIREMENTS • Proficient in developing in multiple languages, including Node.js • Proficient in developing on the AWS platform/stack • Proficient in the use of SQL  • Able to crank out meaningful quantity of high-quality work product in limited time • Self-motivated, self-organizing, comfortable as part of fully virtual team • Good human being, no time for a$$holes • Truly enjoy building cool stuff • Interested in selling what we build for an M&A exit  On the cloud side, we are using Node.js and various AWS services including Cognito, AppSync, SQS, RDS (PostgreSQL), and S3.

Our Senior Full Stack Rails Developer contributes across the stack from understanding database operations at scale, writing clean, team-oriented Ruby, and building compliant UX (via HAML & SASS) that brings our intuitive designs to life for our 40k active sellers. This role touches all realms of Bonanza functionality, though if you find one area you're especially good at, we'd love for you to make it your specialty.  Job Description We're looking for a full-time, full-stack developer with a minimum of 3 years Ruby on Rails experience to help us tackle the many challenges of running a marketplace that scales.  Your projects will vary from sprint to sprint and you will play a critical role through every project’s lifecycle from design to development to maintenance. Some of the stuff we're working on includes:  API: enable sellers and third parties to sell on Bonanza Importers: allow sellers to effortlessly bring inventory from platforms including eBay, Shopify, and CSV Broadcaster: an advertising platform that takes Google Adwords and makes it comprehensible Fraud and compliance: keeping disallowed items and bad actors off the platform Mobile-first UX Third party integrations (checkout, dispute management, OAuth signup and login) Obviously these bullets only scratch the surface of the tasks we'll be working on at a given time.

We are looking for developers who can come up to speed on new skills and technologies, turn that into a regular cadence of completed work, and who have time management skills to get through all their tasks coding or otherwise.  Job Benefits Bonanza is a product-first company run by a CEO who has spent most of his adult life as a Programmer. The implications of this are that we've obsessed for literally years about how to foster an environment optimized for Developer happiness and throughput. It starts with our salaries, which, at the high end, range to levels beyond those offered by the tech titans. More importantly, we provide a working environment where you will virtually never be interrupted by meetings, and where you will be given access to the best hardware available. Because your productivity should never constrained for lack of resources.

Twice-weekly catered lunches. Professional development opportunities. Work from a waterfront office in downtown Seattle (food trucks aplenty!) convenient to many bus lines.

We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our Portland development team. You will work with a cross-functional Tech team (product, UX, engineering, and QA) to build the next generation of features for Schedaero, the charter aviation industry’s most popular web application for flight quoting, scheduling, and business aviation operations.    Who are we looking for?  You are the right person for this job if you:  Bring 3+ years of experience developing responsive web applications using a modern JavaScript framework (we use React for new development, while maintaining some legacy pages using older JavaScript technologies), as well as CSS and SASS. Thrive in an environment where you will be asked to both improve our front-end code and the infrastructure that powers it (our toolset currently includes NPM, Node, Webpack, and Babel). Can mentor other engineers on your team who are building their React skills. Have basic C# and .Net MVC experience with a focus on REST APIs. Care about automated testing (Jasmine and Jest experience are a plus). Know your way around agile software development. We tend to follow Kanban, but aren’t religious about it. Have recent experience with source control and bug tracking software (we use Git and Jira). Are an independent self-starter who isn’t afraid to ask questions. Communicate well. With offices in multiple time zones and multiple countries, this position requires strong written and verbal communication skills.  Why Avinode?  This is why we like it here: Interesting products mean interesting projects to work on. Flight management is a tricky business, and we all enjoy the challenge of helping our customers manage their flight schedules, pilot rosters, and aircraft fleets. Our products are used around the world - we're proud of that. Business aviation is kind of a glamorous industry, but we're a casual, laid-back office: we get along well, eat breakfast as a team once a week, eat lunch together frequently, and enjoy an occasional beer and MarioKart tournament. We care about the business and the business cares about us: we have a good relationship with management, sales, and support. We're all in this together.   We're small: that means a flat management structure, fewer meetings, and frequent opportunities to impact the software we develop. Software is our thing, but so is raising a family, rock climbing, watching baseball, or (insert your thing here). We have lives outside work and we work hard to keep it that way.  What else should you know?  This is a full-time, salaried position on a team based in Portland, Oregon. Our team is currently 100% remote due to the ongoing COVID pandemic. Post-pandemic, we expect this position to be partly onsite in our downtown Portland office, with the ability to work from home periodically. We offer competitive employee benefits.  About Avinode Group  Avinode Group was the first company to move business aviation online, disrupting an entire industry with a technology-first mindset. Today, we operate a growing suite of applications that 6,000+ air charter professionals use to do their everyday work. We take our role in their businesses seriously and make a point of delivering consistently excellent customer service and unique, ever-improving products. This level of sophistication doesn’t stop us from having fun, however. We “Noders” find it important to enjoy an open and friendly work atmosphere, where a bit of quirky humor is always welcome. With 100 Noders spread between Göteborg, Miami and Portland, our flexible and collaborative culture empowers every single person to come forward with new ideas, to make mistakes and initiate dialogue. Avinode seeks candidates who thrive on exciting assignments and can collaboratively work alongside smart, humorous and dedicated co-workers. Our roots are firmly planted in our core values, which inspire us every day to exceed expectations. We are convinced that diversity contributes to building a more sustainable company and we strive to be good role model for diversity. Across the Avinode Group we actively work to make sure all employees have the same possibilities and rights regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation or disability. To learn more about who we are and what we do, please visit our website: www.avinodegroup.com. About Schedaero  Owned by the Avinode Group, our Schedaero platform is a flight operations solution that streamlines all aspects of fleet management and flight scheduling. Schedaero brings diverse operations together in one place: scheduling, trip management, flight and duty logging. Rather than having data spread out across multiple on-and offline systems, Schedaero keeps data readily accessible 24/7     "

We are well down the path to our first major product release, coming out soon!  OPPORTUNITY This is a ground floor opportunity to join and contribute early, take a major equity stake in the company as part of the core team, and keep the safety of your day job and its salary and health benefits.   • If you want the upside of a major equity stake, you should look at this opportunity. • If you love music, you should look at this opportunity.  • If you love developing truly innovative and fun products, and not just the same old crap, you should look at this opportunity.  We are looking to add a principal full stack engineer to our core team of 8, so in exchange for 10-15 hours per week of part-time work (you can keep your day job and its salary), we can offer you an amount of equity that is twice the amount typically granted to a VP of Engineering in a venture-backed startup for full-time work. This is a serious offer, and only highly qualified and serious candidates will be considered.  REQUIREMENTS • Proficient in developing in multiple languages, including Node.js • Proficient in developing on the AWS platform/stack • Proficient in the use of SQL  • Able to crank out meaningful quantity of high-quality work product in limited time • Self-motivated, self-organizing, comfortable as part of fully virtual team • Good human being, no time for a$$holes • Truly enjoy building cool stuff • Interested in selling what we build for an M&A exit  On the cloud side, we are using Node.js and various AWS services including Cognito, AppSync, SQS, RDS (PostgreSQL), and S3.
